Steps:-

1) First I download the file from Kahli's github repository. Then run the command:

> wc -l mcdonalds.csv

It spits out 14170 as the number of lines.

2) I then used the highcharts scripts to plot a map, just to get an
idea of locations. Judging by the latitude-longitude map, one can
easily filter out the restaurants within the contiguous 48 states from
those that aren't by using a longitudinal demarcation at, say, -130 degrees.

One can therefore determine the number of stores in the 48 states with the command:

> cat mcdonalds.csv | perl -ne 'while(<>){ if(m/(.*),(.*)/) { if ($1 > -130) {print "$_";} } }' | wc -l
It splits out 14063.
